# Calculator The Odin Project ~ Rosecodez 2023

~Difficulties encountered

    Initially I have used the id attribute for getting the value, but with this project I had difficulty making them work in the event listeners for the buttons. I tried to switch between id or class to make the functions work, but it wasn't the great solution since i thought it will give me some trouble in the future, so I have been asking around if it was a good idea. Thanks to one of Odin's community mentors, MaoShizhong, I have learned that I should use the value attribute for all the buttons. It made everything work smoother. The buttons responded and worked well with the value attribute.
